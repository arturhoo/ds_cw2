	javac *.java

To run the server:

  rmiregistry &
	java CityServer <follow on screen instructions for correct parameters>

  java CityClient[2] <follow on screen instructions for correct parameters>

** PLEASE refer to documentation cw2_doc.pdf for correct usage of client. **

Make sure to configure jdbc.properties when needed!
